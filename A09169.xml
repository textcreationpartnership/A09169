            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What is the reaſon for that barr? bycauſe the Ievves might not be tollerated, to match vvith the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; nor religions perſons, vvith the prophane. That opinion taiſteth too much of Iudaiſme and the Tabmud, the barr is remooued, for now vvear vnder the lavv of grace; bothe Ievves and gentiles; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſiſion and vncircumciſion, ar all vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt by faith and Charitie, and incorporated into his bodie and Church.

The Ievves might not marrie vvith of ther trybes, for the promiſe was mayd to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his ſead, which was not to be ſtayned vvith vnpure blood, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of paganiſme: but novv the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is alreadie performed, and the iudicial lavv is abrogated.

Ded not the ſame king
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6201:8"/>
aftervvard, match his ſiſter (a famous proteſtant,) with the Duke of Lorraine, (one of the Champians of the Catholick churche? Ded not Levves the Prince of Conde, (the Archipiller of the french church) apprehend vvith great applavvſe, the overture of a marriage, vvith Marie, Quene of France and Scotland, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanlie had bean performed, yf the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for his own particular, had not layd a block in his vvays. But aboue all others, it is memorable, and worthie to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, vvhat a bloodie quarrel it vvas mayd, that king Edvvard the ſixt, (the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant king in England, might not marrie Quene marie of Scotland, (vvho was euer honored and eſteamed a Catholik), and yet the protector vvould haue mayd no ſcruple of Conſcienc in that. Caluiniſme and Lutheraniſme, ar as oppoſite as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes; and yet they haue matched oft together, and ther Iſſews ar the records thereof. And was it then tollerable in the reformed churches, and is it intollerable vvith Spayne? what then is the cawſe of this great ſcrupuloſitie and feare? Is it for the ſtate of the kingdome, or feare of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations? The huſband is head of the vvyfe, and tho the Infanta vvear born <hi>in familia Imperatrice,</hi> yet ther is no ſoverainetie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6201:8"/>
inveſted in her, she can maik no mutation of State, without the cenſent of the ſtate. And yovv haue the les cavvſe to diſtruſt that, hauing a preſident before of king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, vvho being king of England, yet neither could nor, vvould attempt anie alteration. And yf the proteſtants ar ſure to hould ther religion; it is inhumanitie to repyne, that she shall be ſuffred to enioye hers. No man of honor vvil offend a ladie of ſuch honor, for a quarrel to her ſovvle, to her faithe, and her vvorship of god. What then is the reaſon, vvhy this match is ſo diſtaiſt full? Is it for the hate and odiouſnes of the name and qualities of a Spanyard? ſurelie, <hi>ab initio non fuit ſic,</hi> that is neither an ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t quarrel, nor a naturall impreſſion in the English. For in the tyme of king Edvvard the 3. Ther vvas a firm and fixed amitie betvvean England and Portingal, and of Lancaſter ther king ar diſcended. And for Caſtil, they matched Conſtance the Daughter and heyr of king Peter to Iohn of Gaunt, by vvhoſe right, the crovvn appertained to hym. And his daughter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharin married vvith Henry the third king of Caſtil: and therby, the vvhich remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the Sauoye records, reſignation of that crovvn, vvas mayd by Iohn of Gannt, and ſo all the controuerſie vvas ended,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6201:9"/>
betwean them; and the kings of Spay<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne as floorishing brainches of the tree and ſtock of Lancaſter haue peacablie poſſeſſed that kidgdome. So as Prince Charles shal by this match, vvarme his bedd with his own blood.</p>
            <p>I may add further that king Henry the ſeuenth, married his ſonn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to king Ferdinando his daughter, to continew the ſucceſſion of amitie. I, might remember, the treaties of 1505. betvvean k. Henry the 7. and king Philip, for the preſeruation and noorishment of that league and frend ship. And hovv much, and hovv tenderly Charles the 5. embraced and eſteamed yt, vvell appeareth by the Treatie <hi>arctioris amicitiae</hi> 1543. And by the renoumed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Callice, (the greateſt honor that was evver doon. to the crovvn of England:) and by the treatie 1507. bevvean Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian the Emperor, Charles king of Spayne, and king Henry the 8. by the treaties for entercourſe 1515. and 1520. by the treatie of Cambray 1529. and by that famous treatie, 1542. Thus the tvvo kings and kingdomes ſtill renewed, and noorished mutuallie, and vvarmelie, a perfect frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and kind correſpondencie<hi>:</hi> till the ſchiſme of Henry the 8. the diuorce, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and dishonor of Quene Katharin:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6201:9"/>
and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federation therupon with Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, cooled the zealle of this ſeruent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So as ther vvas at that tyme no ſuch cavvſe of hatred, disfauor or vnkindnes; bevvean theſe tvvo kingdomes. nor anie national diſlike or contention: vvhich firſt, brake out end appeared in England in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Maries tyme, principallie for the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of a new religion (then fiuee yarres old.) For ther vvas no pretenc but onelie that to maik the breach, which Wyat deſired. Yet this is not the trevv and ſole motiue of the grudg: ther is and impoſtume vvhich can not be cured, till it be lanched. The hatred and remembranc of 1588. <hi>Manet alta mente repostum.</hi> It is trew, <hi>Hinc illae lachrimae.</hi> But let vs be indifferent, look vpon the wrongs doone to them, aſwel as ther attemps for reueng. And vnpartially conſider who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the cawſe, and forced them to taik armes? The Moonie intercepted, which the king had ſent to the Duke of Alua: the Aſſiſtanc of the princ of Oreng, by Gilbert, Morgan and others (ther ſeconds): the firſt voiage of Syr Frances Drake: the inuaſion and ſacking of S. Domingo; the protection of Holland, by the Earl of Leiceſter: the infinite depredations and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of mart, (to the wnſpeakable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Speyne): the Philippicae and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6201:10"/>
inuectiues in euerie pulpit: ballets and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in euerie preſs againſt king Philip; wear ſuch prouocations, as flesh and blood, nay crovvnes and ſcepters could hardlie disgeſt. I ſpeak nothing of the Portingal vorage, of the ſurprize of Cales, nor of the Iland viage<hi>:</hi> and can anie vviſe man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that the king of Spayn, vvas not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſuch indignities? vvas it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he vvould ſend a futie, to Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale to reuenge that?</p>
            <p>Yet for all, this hoſtilitie, vvhen his maieſtie: cam to the crovvne: how frendly and quicklie ded the king of Spayne alter his courſe, and ſend the high Conſtable of Caſtil, as the doue owt of the Ark, to ſee yf the flood of mallice vvear fallen, and vvith an Oliue brainch in his hand, to ſeak for peace: to maik an Amneſtia, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual obliuion of all vnkyndnes paſt: to couer all offences, to burie all quarrels, and to reconcile the two crovvnes, and the ſubiects thereofs. And ſurelie Curſed vvil he be, vvho shal ſeak to violate that peace; and vnder the coolor of religion, to banish peace and Charitie (the badges of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.) a malicions Cayn he is, that maiks all contentions perpetuall: and ſearſehe can he be holden loyal, that reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth onelie the ſudes and quarrels vvith Scotland,

and not what, and how dear wnto vs it is now, and ſo should be euer embraced and eſteamed. Furthermore, the Crovvn of England, shal hearby, be thus more, beautified and magnified. But ſtaye. My pen shall intrude no further, into the ſecret Cabbienet of counſel, wthowrt warrant. Bycauſe I kow not, whether it be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the kings pleaſure: or whether it be ſit, to be diſcourſed: and ſpeciallie bycauſe I hold it impoſſible, forme to ſatisfie ſo profovvnd a Iudg, vvithovvthis ovvn inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructions, and directions. For I conſider vvel, hovv vnſearchable the ſecrets of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces art, vvhich lie oft in abiſſo, and ar too deape to be ſovvnded by euerie shallow diſcourſer. And I remember alſo, both what praying and preaching, vvas vſed, againſt the match of Quene Elizabeth vvith Monſieur, (in the like caſe, and for feare of alteration, and afterclaps): and yet ſome, vvho ded then moſt impugn it, vnder pretenc of religion: ded in dead, leaſt of all other counſellors regard reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Syr Philip Sydnie, like a noble and vvourthie courtier) laboured by a short treatiſe, to preſent to her Maieſties iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the vntfitnes, diſproportion, and inconuenience of that match, bothe to her ſelf, and the realme: but he ded it,

And tho ſome of the greateſt and vviſeſt conſellors, ded earneſtlie ſollicit, and ſeake to further the match, bycauſe it vvas like both to vnithe the kingdome of france to England: and was ſure, that the poſſeſſion of the Netherlands, wold alſo be offred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the prince of Oreng and the ſtates, whearby England was like to be a moſt potent Monarchie: yet was the whole bodie of the kingdom caſt into much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, onelie which bare conceapts and iealoſies. Some vpon partialitie and faction: ſome for diſtruſt of the practiſes of France: ſome for ther own or ther frends, ſiniſter ends and ambition: as Iam perſwaded, euen in this caſe ther ar men poſſeded, with the ſame diſeaſes and humors. And yf I ded not wel know, the nature of the multitude, (a beaſt of manie heads, and mad braynes: I should wonder, how they durſt oppoſe the deſſeins of a king of that experienc, and iudgment, who haith managed this buſienes, with ſo great warienes, caution,

            <p>Anno 1515 Martin Luther, an Auguſtin <note place="margin">Luther.</note> Friar, (a man of a turbulent ſpirit, learned, and yet no famous Clark,) vvas the firſt, that broke this long and ſetled peace: vvho hauing interpoſed hym ſelf in that fatall buſienes of the Indulgences, (ſent by Pope Leo the tenth into Germanie) not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appertainning to hym, but as a proctor for the order; he begonn firſt to inuaigh againſt the iniurie do one to his fraternitie, <note place="margin">His reuolt.</note> againſt the abuſes and couetouſnes of the collectors, and againſt ther authoritie which ded nominate them, and required ſuch a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of mooine in that nature.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6201:15"/>
Thus he ſtood in armes, and as a challenger for a fow yearres, onelie againſt the defects of the cleargie, and with owt much dainger, for diuers good men conceaued at firſt, that he had onelie intended and ſought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of diſorders, renouation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, punishment of irregularitie, and amendement of lyfe.

            <p>In this humor, he fed hym ſelf, with great hopes, to conquer the world with the ſword of the ſpirit; and to ſubdew the Pope (whome he was the firſt that affirmed to be abſolutelie, Antichriſt, the man of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inſignis praeſtigiator.</p>

To conclude, no part of the bodie of the empyre, was cleare from that plague of conſpiratie: for as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in the contrie, ſo the common people in the imperial townes, conſpired together to reforme religion, and to remoue ſuch magiſtrates, as ſupported the old. At <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the people, degraded and committed all ther officers. At <hi>Frank-fort,</hi> with more furie, they ſpoyled the churches, banished the cleargie, and placed all authoritie and gouernement of the cittie, in tvventie fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re commoners, (to vvhome they gaue all command and rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And the ſame ſpirit like wiſe mooued diuers priuate men, by ther own meand, to attempt reformation. So Frances Sicking, a Lutheran, owt of his zeale, (yet ſome geue owt, that he was incited by Bucer and Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampad, to that action) leuied diuers companies, inuaded and ſpoyled the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Bushop of Trier; took by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalt a ſtrong place, of the princes poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and marched with his armie to the verrie walls of Trier, (purpoſing to beſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that) withowt anie iuſt cawſe of warr, or particuler quarrel. Whear yf he had preuayled, the riches of that place, and ſome others depending of that, would both haue encooraged and enabled them to greater attempts. But he vvas forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre; and ſo being apprehended, he and his complices vvear iuſtlie attainted, and ther lands confiſcated.</p>
            <p>And to maik vp the totall ſome of all the miſeries of Germanie, in full meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this inundation of furie, was ſo generall, that they mayd all church goods a praye and bootie, broke Down Cathedral chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ranſacked all monaſteries, and robbed and ſubuerted both Bushops and Busho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks, as Magdeburgh (the ſeate of the

            <p>I wonder theſe two great doctors, wold affirm this ſo confidentlie; knowing firſt, that though in ſome places of his books (to bleare the eyes of the world) he had perſwaded ſubiects to obedience, (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wheareof, it had bean too groſſe an error to mantaine:) yet that his practiſe, and actions vvear fullie contradictorie to that courſe. And knowing alſo, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hym ſelf, ſet it down as a deuine decree <hi>l. de captiu. Babilon. c. de baptiſmo.

            <p>And after vvard he ſaith again, <hi>Mans lavves bynd not the conſcienc,</hi> for then they should bynd <hi>in all places alike.</hi> And ſo he concludes in generall, <hi>The magiſtrate is to be obeyed for conſcienc, but his particular lavves bynd not the conſcienc:</hi> that is as in an other place he interprets it, <hi>VVe muſt obey humain lavves, bycaus they arr neceſſarie for peace; but vve muſt distinguish them from deuine, vvhich ar ſimplie to be obeyed, vvithovvt defferenc of tyme, place, or circumſtanc, as mans lavves ar.</hi>

            <p>And S.

authoritie of magiſtrates and lawes.</p>
            <p>And the words of Luther litterallie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as much, els what english can yow maik of, <hi>ab omnibus hominum legibus exempti ſumus?</hi> Is it againſt the Canon law onelie? the words <hi>omnibus hominum,</hi> teach yow the contrarie; is it to prefer Gods lawe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>comparatiue,</hi> before mans? the word <hi>(Exempti)</hi> vſed ſimplie, showes the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and that as we ar freed from the law of the Pope, or conſtitutions of Bushops: ſo and in the ſame degree, we ar (as he holds) exempted from all mans lawes, ſo as <hi>neque vllus hominum,</hi> haith power to enact one ſillable, wherto he shall be obliged.</p>
            <p>Again, yf we be exempted from all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes; and the magiſtrate but by lawe, can clayme no obedienc: what concluſion, can yow maik to defend Luther, but in a mood and figure bad enough?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I am perſwaded all men of vnder ſtanding will think the verrie words of Luther, plainlie, and in the litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſence to be daingerous; yf they be not qualified, and bettered by ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as D. whitakers.

            <p>And D. Whitaker hym ſelf, ſeing he could not iuſtifie the words, ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the meaning therof, by a deuiſe and ſence of his own making, vvhich he inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into the words.</p>
            <p>But Luther excellentlie expreſſeth his own meaning <hi>libro ad nobilit atem Germanie;</hi> for as of the Imperial chamber at Spyres, he had giuen this ſentenc, <hi>Tribunal Camerae Imperialis, ecce quàm diabolica eſt meretrix:</hi> ſo hear he ſaith, <hi>Ferunt nulium eſſe pulchrius regimen, quam apud Turcam, qui tamen neque Canonicum neque ciuile ius habet, ſed ſolum Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choranum. At nos fateri oportet nuſquam eſſe turpius regimen, quam apud nos per ius ciuile &amp; Canonicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Novv ballance and examin this vvel; end that vvil determin the controuerſie; we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Luther, that he vvould abolish all lavves, and that men should be ruled one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by the goſpell, and that vpon ſuch his doctrine the paiſants wear incooraged to taik armes.</p>
            <p>No ſaith maiſter vvhitaker, it vvas not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6201:30"/>
Luthers meaning (for the words he could not denie) to abrogate the authoritie of lawes; but his meaning was they ded not bynd the conſcienc.</p>
            <p>Now what Luther meant, appeared by ſeuerall places before, but now he explay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all, and leaues no dowbt. For heare he reiecteth all lawes both ciuil and canon, and ſetts this brand of infamie vpon them, <hi>nuſquam turpius regimen:</hi> and ioynes both the lavves <hi>ſub eodem iugo,</hi> to dravv after the Alchoran, and come short of that: and ſo he reiecteth and diſgraceth the poſitiue and politick lawes of Germanie.</p>
            <p>For vvho vvould obeye lavves vvorſe then the Alchoran? or obey magiſtrates, vvho govern by them, worſe then the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havves?

            <p>But all this, <hi>quo vvarranto,</hi> was it doon? Is it tollerable, for Luther a priuate man, withowt anie euident authoritie, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs commiſſion, to diſanull all lawes, and maik a Metamorphoſis of the world, at

I think in dead he was ſent, and God permitted hym to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit his church: as he permitted Satan to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit holie Iob.</p>
            <p>That ſo by haereſie and tyrannie, he might awake the world, reuiue deuotion, and be a mean to punish ſinn, and purge ill humors, (which could not but a litl infect the natural bodies of the viſible church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo maine hundred yeares, of peace and plentie.)</p>
            <p>It may be, that he fownd the lights in the church burning ſome what too dimm. Yet tho he ded ſnuff it, he had no povver either to put owt the candl, or remooue the candlſtick.

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Old Iolm Frederick, Duke of Saxonie, together with the Lanſgraue of Heſſen, and diuers others (all protectors of Luther, and his goſpell,) firſt entred into a league at Smalcald, (a town in Henſſia, vpon the fronters of Saxonie) onelie for ther own defenc, and the maintenanc of ther reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and liberties, (for bothe of theſe ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly ar now mayd the vſual cloke, of conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piracies) againſt all men, that should in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and ſeak to perſequute them.

            <p>The which league, was again renewed at Frankfort; and confirmed with generall and ſolemn proteſtation, (vvhearupon there and at Auſpurgh the name of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, was deriued originallie.)</p>
            <p>After that, anno 1536. fearing leaſt the Emperor should either preuent, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

            <p>The Imperiall towns, Auſpurgh, Vlm, Strasburgh, and Frankfort ſent them ayd.</p>
            <p>The Count Palatine, leuied two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe for them, (but wiſelier reuoked them, being on the vvaye:) the Duke of Brunſvvig and his ſonnes, the Duke of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburgh, the yong Marques of Baden, the Princ D'Anhald, the Counts of Furſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh and Mansfeald, ioyned vvith them, in perſon and povver.</p>
            <p>So as the armie contayned abovvt thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skore and ten thovvſant men (vvheareof ther vvas 7700. horſe,) and 112.

            <p>I will not tell yow, a tedious tale and impertinent, the event was this.</p>
            <p>The emperor (for all this huge prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,) became maiſter of the feald and Conqueror: the tvvo generalls (a rare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident) vvear bothe taken priſoners, and ther armie defeated.</p>

            <p>The like mercie for his leyfe, was sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to the Landſgraue.

Tho by all probabilities, it may well be coniectured, that as theſe great princes had in ther own prouincies, extinguished, and buried, the title, ſtate, and Iuriſdiction of Bushops: ſo yf they had wonn the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the daye, and had bean conquerors, they vvold haue vſed the ſame deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the empyre.</p>

Doctors opinions, yow shall fynd therby, that it muſt firſt be prooued, 1. That Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar paſſed the bownds of his authoritie, (or els it is playne they paſſed theirs:) 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie that he commanded things wicked and vngodlie, and againſt gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>I wil firſt demand of them this quaeſtion. When Caeſar or the ſupreme magiſtrate, commandeth anie thing to be doone, (which is not apparentlie, againſt the lawes of the Empyre, then in force) who is to be Cenſor, whether Caeſar paſſeth the bownds of his authoritie? and whether the things he commandeth be impious ar no? They anſwer he ded abſolutelie ſeak to ouerthrow ther liberties, and trew religion, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> Lutheraniſm (which is fownded vpon the trew preaching of the word, and adminiſtration of the ſacraments.) This ſurelie is not a ſufficient anſwer, <hi>ad idem</hi> and to my queſtion: and yet I may replie, that it is, and haith bean an old and vſual ſtratagem of Satan, to oppoſe religion againſt religion: that ſo, he might bring in Atheiſme, and leaue vs no religion.

            <p>The world might iudge Caeſar a verrie ſimpl Prince, yf he wowld either haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his religion or tollerated theirs, vpon the bare credit, of Luthers priuate ſpirit and opinion, or vpon the proteſtation of the Confaederates.</p>

was withowt Iuſtice, ſo ther quarrelis withovvt lavvfull grovvnd. Further more, vvas it lavvfull for the Confaederates, to coyne a nevv religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and taik armes for the defenc of that: and vvas it not more lavvfull for the Emperor to fedenc the old recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued religion, and to reform them?</p>
            <p>The Ruſtiks took armes vpon the ſame pretenc, for religion and libertie: and yet the Confaederates, vvith ther ovvn forces, and vvith great iuſtice and honor ded ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devv the Bovvers. Why then might not Caeſar compell the leaguers to exerciſe the religion eſtablished, vvith a <hi>Quouſquè,</hi> and to obey the lavves not a brogated, and keap the peac of the common vvelth, vvithovvt diſturbance? For the degree and dignitie of the perſons: doth not maik the ſame caſe different.</p>
            <p>But they obiect that Caeſar intended and plotted to Deſtroye them, and ther liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for religion; and ther for they vvear forced to taik armes. Weigh this vvell and yovv shal ſee it vvanteth vveight. It vvas ſurelie inexcuſable for Defendants, to leuie and lead an armie into the feald againſt Caeſar, vvho vvas not in the feald againſt them, nor had anie forces readie a long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me after. They marched to beſeag the Emperor, and ded Driue hym to fortifie
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6201:37"/>
hym ſelf, and come into the feald vvith a handfull of men; and then vvith great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſet vpon his camp, vvho had much a doe, to Defend hym ſelf: far from offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.</p>
            <p>But the Emperor (ſaith D. Bilſon) is not to be obeyed by the ſtates, which abſolute obedienc, for they ar his ſubiects, but <hi>ex conditione.</hi> So then he maketh Caeſar Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but <hi>ex conditione.</hi> And yf maiſter Bilſon meaneth therby to charge Caeſar (as the Hollanders ded the king of Spayne,) with the oath taken at his coronation, to obſerue ther lawes, and defend ther liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and ſo taik that for a condition: the like oath is taken, by all kings and princes <hi>Succeſſiue,</hi> as wel as <hi>Electiue</hi> And yf yovv haue deuiſed a trick to vnking them, when yow think they performe not punctuallie, each article of ther oaths: ſurelie yow then may be iuſtlie tearmed a moſt learned doctor, to maik <hi>nullities.</hi> And yet I think, yf anie man preach this doctrine at Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Croſle, he haith great luck, yf he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer not for it, at Towre hill.</p>
            <p>But I wil leaue skirmishes, and come to the maine poynt. It may iuſtlie be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that Caeſar ded obſerue the lavve: and that the leaguers ded violate both the lavves, and liberties of Germanie. For
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6201:37"/>
what prince ſo euer ſtands <hi>rectus in Curia,</hi> and haithe the ancient lawes to back and warrant hym; muſt neads be iudged to hold a better and lawfull plea, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects armed againſt ther prince with priuat opinions onelie, nouelties, and an Alcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran of ther own making.</p>
            <p>But at that tyme, by lawe, Caeſar was bownd rather to banish and extirpate Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſme, then to tollerate the ſame: for yt is manifeſt, that he was obliged by the oath at his Coronation, expreſſlie and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie, to defend the Pope, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and the religion thereof. This is a matter of fact, and can not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, as yowr own Coldaſtus knovveth and acknowledgeth.</p>
            <p>Neither was yt a new oath: for the ſame in effect was taken, by <hi>Carolus</hi> 4. <hi>Otho</hi> 3 <hi>Otho</hi> 1. and <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> which is a praeſcription, for tyme good enough, and for reaſon vndiſputable. And the like profeſſion, yow shall fynd to be mayd, by the ancient reuerend Emperors, Iuſtinian, Theodoſius, Gratian, and others bothe in the Code, and <hi>Nouel constitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then how could the Emperor either mantain or ſuffer anie other religion (as authentical) then that vvhich he fovvnd eſtablished in the Empyre, allovved by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6201:38"/>
all his predeceſſors, warranted by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie councels, continued ſo manie genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, racified by the diets, and confirmed by his own oath.</p>

Not vvith ſtanding the Duke reiected the motion, and much diſpleaſed the Emperor therby: (vvho plainlie replied, that yf they obeyed not, they should repent it.

Maximilian the 1. ded forbed all ſubiects of the empyre, to gene ayd to the french king in his warrs. Emicho, Earl of Lingen in contempt of the edict, went into France, and tooke paye of the french king for hym and his companies. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror being aduertiſed thereof, proclaymed hym traytor, gaue the ſpoyle of his howſe, and confiſcation of his lands to the princes of the empire, irrecouerablie. Novv yf Maximilian, might thus punish Emicho by lavv, for going to ayd France, contrarie to his proclamation: what might he haue downe, yf he had taken armes againſt hym ſelf, (as the confaederats ded againſt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.) And for the Imperiall townes, ther fault was moſt groſſe, and deſerued moſt punishment. for <hi>Ciuium Imperalium, ſolum Imperator Dominus eſt, non magistratus munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palis.</hi> And touching ther liberties, ans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Gayle ſayd trewlie and iudiciouſlie, <hi>Germanicae libertatis iniqua eſt iactatio,</hi> againſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6201:42"/>
the Emperor. So then I refer it to the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment, of anie vnpartial Iudg, whether the action, and proceading, of theſe two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and greate perſons, for ther religion, and defenc of Lutheraniſme, weare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by lawe, or no: and ſpeciallie, being directlie againſt the Emperor, and the religion eſtablished in the Empyre.</p>
            <p>And concerning Luther hym ſelf: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> of all theſe motions, in that Orbe: and the <hi>malus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> that inſpired the people and conducted and directed all; and for the defenc of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe doctrine, all theſe ſwords wear drawen: cann yow think, yf the Princes wear faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he is free and innocent?

I vvill recapitulate nothing of his miſdemeanors vvhich, I haue alledged before, towards the Emperor and Princes: I will not accuſe hym for vſurping the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities of Caeſar, and for making and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing politick Lawes <hi>De communi fiſco,</hi> (one of the greateſt marks of ſoouerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:) and how the reuennues of the church should be employed, when the Abbeies wear pulled downe, (though that proiect wear as good, as an exhortation to ruine and pull them downe.)</p>
            <p n="1">1.

For as Lutger was harsh, ſtearne, and violent, neither vſing modeſtie nor goot manners: ſo Caluin was more cautelous, of a more ſubtil ſpirit, and appeared at firſt to the world, in humilitie, and couered with the foxes skin. Luther was the original cawſe; but Caluin glorieth that he gaue the perfection of all. So both of them weare glorious, both bred in the ſchool of law and contention: both ſpecial frends to pleaſure and the flesh, and neither of them commended much for pietie or deuotion.</p>

it ſeams ſomething hard; yet the compariſon ſo ſtanding as he maiks it (whether it wear better, to contemn ther impious edicts, or to obey them:) Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin vrgeth it in vehement wordes. And this is farr from Rebellion.

And this act, vvhich others vvould shadow, Beza iuſtifieth ſo boldlie: that in the ſame place, (commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the good ſeruices at Meaux and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, and that famous battel of Dreux, vvhearin he vvas a principal, not an acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he addeth, <hi>Id quod eo liberius teſtor, quod iſtis tum Concilijs, tum etiam pleriſque rebus, quando it a Deo viſum est<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> interfui.</hi> To that place, (obiected to the Caluiniſts, as an argument to convinc them of ſeditious, both doctrine and practiſes) maiſter Bilſon shovveth much care, and ſtudie, to anſvver.</p>

               <p>At larg, I ſeth down his Apologie for Beza, and the reaſons: bothe by canſe D.

               <p>Touching the firſt poynt, he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the battell of Dreux, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the law, nor the king: and yet in the 5. he corrects and contradicts hym ſelf, confeſſing that he knowes not the lawes of the land, nor the circumſtanc of the warr. So yovv ſee this great Doctor had a conſcienc: to affirm the certantie of a matter, whareof he had not ſcienc. And ſo I might leaue hym bett, with his own weapon. But was that battel neither againſt law, nor prince? aſſuredlie againſt bothe, as yow shall fynd by the lawes of Charles the VIII. 1487. and of Frances the firſt 1532. and of Frances the 2. at Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau

               <p>But how doth D. Bilſon, prooue that the battel of Dreux vvas not againſt the king? Bycauſe, the 1. Duke of Guiſe, ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cawſe that battel, and 2. armed hym ſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> into the feald, in hate of the nobles; 3. hym ſelf being a ſtrainger: and 4. the king being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in his hands? It ſeames this man was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> well inſtructed, or that his wiſe patron had not leaſure to peruſe and examin it: he tells ſo manie vntruthes together. Firſt it is certan, that battel was not in king Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his tyme, but in the raign of Charles the ninthe; and after the death of king Frances, all men knovv, (that vvear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted vvith the proceadings of that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me) that the howſe of Guiſe ded beare no ſwaye in the court: the Duke vvas mayd a ſtrainger to the ſtate, his vvings vvear clipt; the Quene moother, the king of Nauar, and the conſtable ſat at the ſtearne and guided all.

Duke of Guiſe led the Areargard; and tho it was his fortune to ſtand maiſter of the feald, and winn the glorie of the daye: yet had he not anie charge at that batl, but of his own companies.

               <p>And whear he ſaith, that the proteſtant Princes took armes, onelie to ſaue them ſelfs from ther oppreſſion by Mr. de Guiſe? it is a blind reaſon, for a cleare cavvſe.

is, bus a mask; for Beza hym ſelfs, playnlie confeſſeth, that the feald vvas fought, for this end, vvith ther blood to reſtore religion.</p>
               <p>And wher as he inveigheth ſo hotelie, againſt the Duke of Guiſe, that he was a ſtrainger in France: it ſeames he knew not, that the Duke was diſcended of the line and brainch of Charlemaigne, (who vvas no ſtrainger in France?) or that he hym ſelf was a peare of France: that he was cooſen German to the Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die; or that his moother was Anthonette de Bourbon: and that his predeceſſors, had long enioyed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and honor, in the court of France.

(But that dreame, that the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of Guiſe aſpyred to the Crowne, (yf the king and his iſſew fayle<hi>:)</hi> is to be pittied rather then anſwered: a fable (taken owt of the legend of Lorrain,) and the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells of that tyme.

And ſo though the kings bodie natural in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie can not diſcern and iudg: yet that diſableth not a king, that the acts of his minoritie, ordered by his counſell, and by the Regent, should be of no validitie. Nay, your own Hottoman, in his Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallia, will teach yow an other leſſon, (tho he was Bezaes truſtie Achates.)

doth it not teach ſubiects, to rebell, and to plead, <hi>ſic dicit Dominus,</hi> for ther defence? but note well how fynelie, he fortifieth this axiome. pag. 132.

               <p>I paſſe over, the infinit trowbles, labor, and charges, that king Lewes was forced to bear and endure, all that ſommer and winter: I omitt the garboyles at Toures: and the practiſe of the Rochellers, to put in 6000. men into Saumur; therby to cut owt ſufficient vvork for the armie thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowt, and ſo hinder ther march to Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.

               <p>I vvill not exaggerate, the treacheries and conſpiracies of Vatteuile, in Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (plainelie prooued, by his papers and inſtructions intercepted:) whearupon the Duke of Longueuille, was conſtrayned to diſarme them of Deape, Roan and Caen, to preuent the dainger, yf they should ioyn vvith Vatteuil. But I vvill beginn vvith S. Iohn d'Angely; vvhich held ovvt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſubmiſſion long, (the king, being there in perſon:) and though Monſieur de

Soubize vvas ſommoned to render the tovvne, or ſtand to the perill and attaint of treaſon, yet they ded hold owt and defend it, ſo long as there remained anie hope.</p>
               <p>How was his Maieſtie defyed and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, at Montauban wheare he continued at the ſeage a long tyme, vvith noble, and moſt expert ſoldiers, not with owt the deathe and loſſe, of manie gallants, and men of good deſert and ſeruice (ſpecially the tvvo brothers, the Duke de Mayn, and Marquis Villars, who wear generallie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.) Yet the Conſuls wold not yeald, the commons vvear obſtinate: and ſo the king by good aduiſe raiſed the ſeage. And after his departure, the <hi>Inſolent Burgers,</hi> led (as in a triumphe) all the Cleargie of the towne, with skorn full indignities. And the Huguenots in Montpellier and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock, depriued Monſieur Chaſtillon from all gouernemens, by ſentenc of the conſiſtorie, and razed 36 churches.</p>
               <p>Now as theſe reformers vſurp vpon the Royalties of the king: ſo ar they as bold with the inheritanc of priuate Lords, vvhen it may ſerue ther turns. They vvold not ſuffer, the <hi>Vicount Leſtrainge,</hi> to enioye his lordship of <hi>Priuas,</hi> bycauſe he was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik: and they put hym owt of his ovvn caſtel of Lake (vvhereof the Marshall

Neither would theſe good men, permitt the kings Iuſtices (being delegated thether, to compound the controuerſies) either to heare maſſe, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue anie vſe of ther religion.</p>
               <p>What ſocietie, what common welth can ſtand and continew, yf this Anarchie ſtand and beare ſuch ſwaye? Yf by pretenc of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they may diſſeiſe the right owner: and hold what they can compaſſ, for the vſe and aſſuranc of ther confaederates?</p>
               <p>But why doe they ryot, and rage thus? what cawſe haue they, to run ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſobedient courſes? the king is graciouſlie content, they should quietlie and ſafelie vſe and exerciſe ther own reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: yet this contents, them not; they will not demean them ſelfs, quietlie nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe peaceable with the Catholiks: nor obey the kings lawes, in temporall affayres. yovv can neither dowbt, nor be ignorant of this.</p>
               <p>For ded not the king aſſure them, at S. Iohn d'Angely, that he would protect all of the reformed religion, that wold obey hym, and obſerue his edicts? ded he not

But to return to the matter, what probabilities, what vehement preſumptions, ded they produce againſt her? 1. she mourned fayntlie for his death, (which was a ſign she was wearie of his lyfe.) and 2. again, she acquited Bothwel for his death, and ded not punish hym.

               <p>And touching the Murder, the Lord Harris, accuſed Murrey of it: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, bycauſe at Cragmillar caſtel, he, Murton, and Bothwel, conſulted, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and determined the kings death: and ther wear indenturs mayd, and ſubſcibed for the effecting of it.

               <p>And yet is it mayd more manifeſt by this, and ther cryme and practiſe more odious: for to blind the world, firſt they took armes, as they ſayd, to apprehend Bothwel; and after they ſent owt shippes to purſew hym at ſea Both, wear fallacians: for they never meant it. for yf they wold haue apprehended hym: vvhy ded they diſmiſſ hym? and why ded they ſend the Lord Graing, to aduiſe and will Botwell to depart, and promiſed that none should follow, and purſew hym? and ſo in dead no man was haiſtie to doe it, (tho he ſtayed two months till Murries return<hi>:)</hi> for they knew, that by taking hym, they should be bewrayed them ſelfs; and therfor they meant to betray and ouerreach hym; and offer hym vp, as a ſacrifice to the mallice of the world, for ther own purgation.</p>
               <p>So then theſe two Catelines cawſed the king to be ſlayne, and vſed Bothwels aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc and help in it: and then accuſed bothwel, and the Quene, as the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and contriuers of it.

Now to diue to the bottome and deapth of the cawſe.</p>
               <p>The E. Murrie never loued trewlie the Lord Darlie: he was once in armes and in the feald to haue kild hym; and therupon fled into England (wherby appeared his good diſpoſition.)

After ward the lord Darlie, then king) ſeing his own dainger, craued, and obtained the Quenes gracious pardon: and yet fearing leaſt Murrey might miſinform the Q. againſt hym, reſolued to kil Murrey, and diſcouered his intention to the Q. abowt it, who would not ſuffer nor endure to hear it.</p>
               <p>This comming to Murries knowledg; as he had before practiſed to eſtraing the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne from her huſband; and offerd to procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and ſew ovvt her diuorce from hym (vvhich she vtterlie condemned<hi>:)</hi> ſo novv he reſolued to haue hym mayd avvaye, (and yet conninglie before the murder) he went from the court, and after into France, that he might be thought innocent, in the matter.

And trewlie all thes things appeared, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the Quenes commiſſioners, who hard the cavvſe at york: as it ſeamed by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Syr Raphe Sadlers (touching that buſienes<hi>:</hi> vvhich I haue ſean<hi>:)</hi> but it vvas mayd aftervvard as cleare as the ſonn, by the execution of the E. of Murton.</p>

               <p>Alſo Syr Nicholas Throgmotton, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the ſame tyme in Scotland, (but vpon other pretences:) and was a fitt man to further the contriuing of that buſienes, (and what wynd ſoever ded blow hym thither: he ded his work, like a conning ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, and deſerued well to haue bean crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lord Hurlie.)</p>
               <p>Afther thes preparations, cam the lord Lindſey with commiſſion from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, (whoſe hand had bean washed before in Dauids blood:) and with ſtearn and grim looks, tendered the writings vnto her: vvith fearfull threatning, yf she ded refuſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therupon she ſubſcribed them being a priſoner; and to ſaue her lyfe, loſt her crown.</p>
               <p>Call yovv this a free reſignation? The act of parliement in dead calleth it ſo (1567) and she gaue power to the l.

I vvill tell yow, owt of <hi>Aeſopes fables,</hi> a tale, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, and refresh yow.</p>
               <p>In Affrica ther wear two great foreſts, near adioyning. in the one a Lyon gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the beaſts, in the other a Lyones. The Lyon (being rich, and full of praye and booties:) feared leaſt the Lyones should ſeak a forrein mate, and growe of greater ſtrenth, and inuade his foreſt: and therfor called a councel of his beaſts, to aduiſe, how he might reſt quiet and aſſured. The bull (preſuming of his ſtrenth, and vſed to gore, all the forren vvolfs that cam in his vvalk) together vvith the bore, and the beare, contemned theſe vayne feares. An old Ape, that liued in the foreſt, and was vſed to counterfeit, perſwaded the Lyon to fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne kyndnes, <hi>For great harts, vvear ſooneſt vvonn vvith fayr ſemblance.</hi> Reignard (the fox) diſliked not that: but knovving that the Lyones, had manie hongrie and raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wofs, and wilie foxes abowt her: adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lyon, to ſend the goat, (a graue bearded perſonage,) to viſit the Lyones, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6201:82"/>
renew frendship: and vnder that coolor, to Deale both with ſomme of the wolfs and foxes: and bread in them a iealouſie of the lyones, and fear of her creweltie: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for to perſwade them, to ſtand vpon ther gard, and maik them ſelfs a free ſtate, and ſo liue at libertie and vnder no command.</p>
               <p>The Goat performed the ſeruice wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Now emong the beaſts vnder the lyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ther was a Mongrel in greateſt fauor: he hearing the motion conſulted with his brethren, and vndertook the buſienes; but ſayd he, we haue emong vs crevvel beaſts, what yf they shall diſlike this, and ſeak to deuowr vs? fear not that, ſayd the Goat, we will ſend vow maſtifs to gard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend yow. Yea, but ſayd the Mongrel, what shall we be the better, or the fuller fedd by this: oh ſayd the Goat, all the pray is his, who is maiſter of the feald: get yow the Lambe, and leaue them by th' eares for the purtenance. Thearupon, the Mongrel, with the wolfs and foxes that wear his frends: conſpired, entraped the Lyones: and drew her to fall into a deape pitt, owt of which she neuer recouered.</p>
               <p>Raignard hearing of this, ſent vnto the Mongrell, to gett alſo into his cuſtodie, the Lyones whelp<hi>:</hi> and ſo he should be ſure, preſentlie to rule and haue all; for I haue
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6201:83"/>
fownd, ſaid he, by experienc, <hi>that a preſent morſell is euer svveateſt: and poſſeſſion is the cheaf poynt in lavv.</hi> And aftervvard either the whelp may die; or it shall liue at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and diſpoſe. This is the fable: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral I leaue, til I can haue tyme to expownd it and moother Hubbars, tale together. For Heare I would gladlie end, this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Puritan church of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the beginning, and the progreſſ thereof: but that I perceaue, yow deſyre to know alſo the trew cawſe of this fierie diſtemper, and the incredible contempt of all authoritie, (which is an accident inſeparable to them;) vvhenc it ſpringeth, and vvhy it is more peculiar and proper to a Caluiniſt, then to anie other ſect. I will show yow breaflie my conceipt. Caluin, vvhen he vvas (after his expulſion) inuited home againe from Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, wheare he liued with Bucer, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked long of his milk: by the perſwaſion of his frends, he was content to return to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua; vpon condition that he might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish his new diſcipline, (the Idea wheareof he had apprehended in Germanie.)</p>
               <p>So by general conſent, he returned: and shortlie after erected his conſiſtorie: which is the Quinteſſenc of Puritaniſm, the Oligarchie of Elders, and the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Geneua. A ſtrayne of pollicie, farr
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6201:83"/>
aboue Luthers groſſe reach. For ſo he ded foreſee, he might become the Dictator of the church at home, and abroad: at Geneua ſpeciallie, to cenſure all offendors, bridle all oppoſitions, and perpetuallie inveſt the eldors (by that authoritie) in the ſooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie and gouernment, bot he of the town and church (which of an Epiſcopal Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, they mayd now a perfect oligarchie.) And that it might be receaued abroad with more reuerenc, and be obeyed more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlie, and be plauſiblie entertained in the world (tho it wear the Idol of his own phantaſie.) They ſet it dovvn as a mark of the trew Church of Chriſt, and ioyned it, in aequal rank: vvith the preaching of the word, and adminiſtration of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neceſſarilie, fundamentallie, and inſeparablie.</p>
               <p>So then this great Soldan of the Lake, ſending his Mammalucks, into euerie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of France, planted the firſt reformed churches there, after this modele of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua. Therby the ſynodes, and aſſemblies of France, impatronized them ſelfs vpon the principal townes in the kingdome: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated with the nobilitie and commons; and had mutual intelligenc to hether.

and intereſt, to preuent the propagation of the Martiniſts, and other nevv ſectaries, latelie ſprong vp in theſe contries. And he could deuiſe no better remedie, then to eſtablish the Inquiſition there. (vvhich he ded anno 1550.) Wheareof Marie Quene of Hongrie then regent, to her great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, procured both a mitigation, and an explanation.

(vvhich is the gold myne, and maintenanc of theſe prouinces.) But in dead, they knew beſt ther own diſeaſe, and what afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſcourge they should be ſubiect to: being for the moſt part inclined to innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. and this they apprehended, as the firſt cavvſe of ther commotions.</p>
               <p>2. Beſides an other prudent and politique act, added more fevvel to the fyre, and an encreaſe of diſcontentment: vvhich was the erection of the nevv bushopricks.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdlie the authoritie and povver of the Bushop of Arras, vvas much diſdained: and his Cardinals hat mayd hym more odious, as a man too ſupereminent in a ſtate ſo popular: and the greater his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to the Pope for his honor, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vvas the mallice of the nobilitie, and the hate of the peopl encreaſed againſt hym.</p>
               <p>4. Furthermore, the better to cloke and couer ther intentions, vvith the vayle of <hi>bonum publicum,</hi> they vrged to enioye ther ancient liberties and freedome: and that no ſtrainger might beare office and rule emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, and that the Spanyards might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from all reſidenc in theſe lands.</p>
               <p>5. Laſtlie and ſpeciallie, they deſyred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, and libertie of conſcienc. So as in effect, the names of religion, and the Commonvvelth, vvear mayd the ſtandard

bearers of all theſe commotions. Novv concerning, theſe greauances: the firſt is a name of more terror, then in dead it is. Not ſo fearfull to good men, but a rack to offendors; deuiſed vpon neceſſitie againſt the Moors in Spayne: and continued, vpon experienc, of the vſe and benefit of it: and tho I can commend no ſign of crevvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet can I not condemn this: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus, it addeth nothing to the punishment of hereſie, (more then the law before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted:) but exacted onelie, a more ſtrict and ſeuear execution, and courſe of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the inquiſitors: it shovveth a more care of the gouernor; when he fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth abuſes and dainger in an offendor. And alſo. bycawſe it was the ſole Antidot, whearby onelie Spayne, is and haith bean, ſo wel and ſo long preſerued, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſects, and the contagion and tumults, which innouation vſuallie ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth (whearwith all the kingdomes in Europe, haue bean embroyled.) And the Spanyards them ſelfs, neuer complayned of it; not felt it ever as a yoke or burden vpon them (who ar not verrie apt, to beare burdens.) Neither is it, <hi>in ſe,</hi> a more bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die lavv, or a more fearfull execution of iuſtice, then the conſiſtorie of Geneua, and the ſeuear commiſſions and procea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of ſome other contries, (as shall hear after appeare, by the compariſon.) Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as is vvas a curſe, zealouſlie at firſt propunded: the execution was likewiſe as wiſelie afterward ſuſpended. So as the iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and fear of an act, more then the action, drew all this blood.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond, it was a politick and prudent inuention. a ſuaffle, to bridl ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and a ſicle, to cut dovvn the vveads growing vp in the church.

And that vvas the cavvſe, why it vvas alovved and ratified by the bull of PIVS IV. anno 1559.</p>
               <p>Novv touching Monſieur d'Arras<hi>:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyt his vviſedome and experienc in affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res both of the church, and the ſtate, vvas ſufficientlie knovven to the kings: yet bycauſe the Prince of Oreng, and the Counts of Horn, and Egmont, ded ioyntlie write to the king againſt hym: his Maieſtie (tho to the great hinderance of his ſeruice,) was content to remooue hym, for ther ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and contentment: and vvhen he vvas called avvaye, neither vvas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie quieter, nor they ceaſed from practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>As for ther liberties and franchiſes, ded not the king at the Ioyfull entrie, confirm them all? then hovv, and when ded he after violate them? vvas it for preferring the Spanyards? there wear few of them left in ahe Netherlands, and fevver <hi>cum imperio.</hi> Was it, for the offices of ſtate? the king

diſtributed all the gouernements emong them ſelfs, (natiues of that contrie:) ſo great truſt and confidence, he repoſed in them. He mayd the Count Egmond Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of Flanders and Artois: the Prince of Oreng, Gouernor of Holland, Zelland, Vtreght, and Burgondie: to the Count Arenbergh, he gaue the gouernement of weſtfrizeland, and over Iſel: to Count Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laymont, Namur: to Count Mansfeld, Luxemburg, and Chinay<hi>:</hi> to the Marques of Berghen Lile and Douay.

goſpel, and a bleſſed leſſon. But yet, I ſee no particularitie alledged, wherby it may appear, that the king ded break his oath: was it for exactions? it is anſwered. was it. for bringing in the Spanyards? it was tyme, and neceſſitie, that mayd the king, to his great trowble, to his greater charge, to his greateſt greafe: to taik armes, to defend the Cleargie, to defend the religion of his anceſtors (according to the lawes and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtomes of theſe prouinces:) and to force them to acknowledg that he was ther Prince.</p>
               <p>Was it for religion? In dead it is trew, ther is a clawſe in the <hi>vnion,</hi> that they ar therby to defend them ſelfs, <hi>contra omnem vim, quae ſub pretextu religionis aut nominis Regij inferetur.</hi> At firſt, the Prince, Horn, and Montigny, offred to Ioyn vvith the people, againſt the Inquſition: they aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted comforted, and encooraged Bredero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: they deſyred and vrged the Religions Vried, and published books to defend it: mayd liberal promiſes to be content vvith the vſe of ther own religion, and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice nor offend the Catholick.</p>
               <p>And with much art, they hid and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ther intentions, the better to draw on the Catholicks to ioyn with them, for the general good of the ſtate. For by that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6201:108"/>
deuiſe, they wonn manie prelates and men well affected in religion, to cooperate with them, for the furteranc and defence of the Archduke Matthias, with ther bodies and goods: and ſtill vnder the fayre names of liberties and religion.</p>
               <p>Now that religions Vried being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was a <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> to the inquiſition, and a prohibition of all violenc, and ſeueritie. and what could they deſyre more? Beſides Holland and Zelland, ever ſince the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Gand, haue bean offendors mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then defendors: and haue enioyed ther Religion, liberties, <hi>&amp; denique quid non?</hi> ſo as they had no iuſt cawſe, to maik this <hi>vnion</hi> and conſpiracie, (ſpeciallie when all other prouinces ſubmitted them ſelfs to the king.) But faction and haereſie is ever humble, till they can get the ſvvord of povver and authoritie in ther hands. For novv, they of Holland, ar in <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> and ſing an other tune: they haue expelled all the Cleargie, ſeazed ther lands and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings: empriſonned, thoſe that vvil not be conformable, to ther Synodes holden at Dort 1574. and at Midlborough. 1581. they haue vſed much crevveltie both in drovvning and executing men for religion: but no toleration they vvill permit; nor more fauor, then to the Puritans, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6201:108"/>
an ſemi-Arrians, emoug them.</p>
               <p>And for the matter: of Religion, at the making of that vnion; they mayd them ſelfs cheaf gouernors of religion and the church, by theſe words. <hi>Quant au poinct de religion, ceux de Hollande &amp; Zellande s'y com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteront comme bon leur ſemblera: &amp; les autres, ſelon le placcard de l' Archiduc Matthias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, by this, belike the States of Holland and Zelland ar aduanced to be head of the church in thoſe prouinces: for all muſt be touching Eccleſiaſticall matters, <hi>comme bon leur ſemblera.</hi> They ar now, the <hi>Regula Lesbia,</hi> to ſquare iudg, direct, gouern, and order all: and what religion they will allowe, that muſt paſſ for currant: and in that manner, and for ſo long tyme, as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Now this authoritie being in the ſtates generall; then that church muſt be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by manie, not by one: one ſpiritual bodie by manie temporall heads, and moſt of them artificers, (merchants of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, brewers of Delft, Staplers of Dort, ſeamen of Horn, &amp;c.) An anarchie, vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thovvt learning: and (vvhich is pittie) a forenoon head, better then an afternoon: too manie for vnitie, too ignorant for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and skarſelie able too determin with iudgment, vvhether the Gomariſts or the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6201:109"/>
Armenians, should be Doctors of the Chayre. And that appeared well, by ther edict published at Haghe 1614. that no man should preach, <hi>Deum aliquos in exitium creaſſe;</hi> which ſentenc was afterward retrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bycaus the heads of the church had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therin, (for they admitt not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as in France, to sharewith them anie part of ther iuriſdiction.)</p>
               <p>Now to draw, to an end: yf the king had taken armes to introduce anie nevv religion (like a Mush-rump growen vp in a night) and to compell the conſciences of his ſubiects to obeye that: I muſt neads ſaye, he had much encroached vpon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the contries, and had incurred iuſtlie ther mallice.</p>
               <p>And I can not but ſaye alſo, that the Hollanders, taking armes againſt ther ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerain, for defenc of ſuch a religion, and innouation: can neither, by law, reaſon, not religion, be excuſed and defended. Now yf the Hollanders be ſo preciſe in vpholding ther religion: yf the Elders of Geneua will permitt no toleration: yf the french church inſult and oppreſſ the poor humble Catholicks, that liue emoug them: yf Romulus by his law enacted, <hi>Deosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinos ne colunto:</hi> yf <hi>Numa</hi> would not heare <note place="margin">

               <p>And yf they of Holland, think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for the peace of ther ſtate: is not the caſe a like for hym? yf for ther conſcienc ſake, they will barr ovvt the Catholick and ancient religion: should he be bard for his conſcienc ſake, to taik the ſame courſe againſt the Caluiniſts? hovv doe ther beginning, and ther proceadings dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? and how doe ther profeſſion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formanc agre? for at firſt they mayd that a cavvſe of ther rebellion that the king vvould force ther conſciences: and yet they will not novv permitt the ſame freedome, to thoſe that liue vnder their command.</p>

And at Coolen, the ſtates deputies added, that they took armes, not onelie for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> religion but to 1. auoyd exactions intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, 2. and to caſt of the yoke of too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere gouernors. So then 1. religion, 2. ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, 3. exaction, 4. abrogation of ther
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6201:110"/>
priuiledges, and the kings own renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his title: arr the pillers of this vnion. It remaineth therfor, after hauing mayd a breach with this long battrie, to geue the aſſault vpon ther title: and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer how ſeditious the poſitions and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that religion ar, which imprinted in them ſuch diſloyaltie to vſurp that title.</p>
               <p>If it could be prooued by them, (which is neceſſarie firſt to be:) that the king ded oppreſſ the contrie by tyrannie, and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ther priuiledges: then is it yet a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of importance, whether therby he haith loſt his authoritie ouer his ſubiects? and yf he had loſt it, by what law haue they fownd it? by what ciuil order or preſident, ded they abiure ther obedience? Surelie it vvas, <hi>certam quandam ac liberam reipublicae formam constituere.</hi> That vvas ther end, and ther preſumption: but it vvas neither order nor cawſe. Neither is the kings ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, a ſufficient vvarrant for ther ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and vſurpation. for a ſoouerain can not looſe his ſoouerainetie: it doth all waies carrie vvith it a <hi>nonobstante,</hi> to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc with errors and irregularities.</p>
               <p>And for ther priuiledges, vvhich the king never intended to maik voyd, (and ſo they build vpon a falſe grovvnd, vvhich vvill fayle them:) yf it had bean ſo great
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6201:111"/>
an offenc, for the king to abrogate theirs; is it not a greater offenc for ſubiects, to vſurp his? and ſo to maik them ſelf parties and iudges, and by ther own authoritie to punish ther prince. Which is an inſolencie and indignitie incredible to all poſteritie; and ſuch as neither the Svvizzes, nor the Amphictiones (the confederate cantons of Grecia:) ded ever match, nor come neare. for ſo they maik, <hi>regna, occupantium ius, qui poteſt capere, capiat.</hi> A pretenc oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to all lavves: a portall to let in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. but yf the king ded looſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all his authoritie and iuriſdiction: yet I ſee not, vvhy or hovv, they could alſo challeng his lands, and priuate inheritance<hi>:</hi> for that muſt neads diſcend by law. Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des yf the king could for feit his ſooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raintie, how can he forfeit it to his ſubiects? but ſay they, wear now no ſubiects; we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue waued and renounced the ſame. and is that inough? It is trew; a ſubiect, may maik hym ſelf <hi>ciuis alienae reipulicae:</hi> but yf he ſtay in his own contrie, he can not of a ſubiect maik hym ſelf no ſubiect; (for tho he doe rebell as the Hollanders ded, yet he is a ſubiect:) but it is admirable, how of a ſubiect he should become a ſooueraine: that is <hi>ſcientia ſcientiarum,</hi> a ſupernatural skill aboue my capacitie,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:6201:111"/>
Yet yf the kings should for feit his earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Holland; it is not to them, but to the cheaf Lord of the fee, that is to the Emperor (for it can eſcheat to no other, either by the Imperial or municipal lawes.) Yf yow ask me the reaſon: I ſaye it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that Holland vvas erected into an Earldome, by the Emperour Carlous Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus <hi>qui cum audiuit, Hollandiam terram Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoriam, a Danis spoliari, rogatu Iohannis Papae, principatum eius contulit Theodorico.</hi>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 863.</p>
               <p>So yf it be not in the king of Spayn, (to whome it is lineallie diſcended from Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric:) then may the Emperor geue a nevv <hi>inueſtitur</hi> thereof, as a fief Imperial, to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he pleaſeth, as he ded to Theodoric. (for it is a phantaſtical imagination, that it is fallen by lapſe to them of Holland.) the Emperor taketh no notice of ther Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hips, (being a priuate order for ther better government.) But yf it be fallen in laps, it is rather fallen to Oreng and the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (who can Better govern) then to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſmen, and mariners. And yet vndowb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie to none of them, except they plead, that as conquerors they wonn yt by the ſword, and ſo they will hold it: which is a Tenure, neither knowen to Litlton, nor <hi>ſumme Rurall,</hi> not <hi>Ius feudale:</hi> a tenure

fitter for <hi>foroſciuti,</hi> or the Hoords of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, then a commonwelth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
               <p>A certan Hollander, in his third defenc, of the vnited prouinces, calleth the king of Spayn, <hi>Raptorem, &amp; haereticum notorium,</hi> rudelie and vnciuillie; and therupon infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>An non potius regem Hiſpaniae, quia hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticus notorius eſt, ex ſuo regno omnibus omnium Euangelicorum viribus, expellere oporteret?</hi> either this man was much diſtempered, or his religion infected hym, and mayd hym a Catelin, and ſo ſeditions.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ar fearefull paradoxes, and ſuch as all princes haue intereſt in; and had nead to haue ther ſwords drawen to confute: yf for pretenc of religion, for errors in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, for reſtraining ther priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for punishing ſedition and ryots: ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects may thus ſit in iudgment vpon ther princes, and taike armes and expell them owt of ther territories.

Beſides it is nor trew, that they haue bean ſo reputed of Princes. to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate with princes vnder that title, and that ſo princes confirm ther title, be different things.</p>
               <p>I grand that they offred to Quene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the ſooueraintie of theſe prouinces, and laboured that she vvould entertain them: but the counſel (ſpeciallie the L.

Although for her own priuate ends, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward she was content to protect them: and he who furthered moſt that protection, was as glad ſo clenlie to be rid of the ſonn: as the Marques of Wincheſter was, to be deliuered of the father.</p>
               <p>And therfor, the Quenes commiſſioners at Burborough, (as I haue hard) affirmed trewlie, <hi>Auerſata eſt Regina delatam ſibi ſaepius illarum regionum ſummam potestatem.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Syr Noel Caron, in Quene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths tyme, eſteamed as an Embaſſador, but as an agent.</p>

               <p>The end, they showed openlie to ayme moſt at, was the defenc of ther priuiledges, and the protection of ther religion. but this was not the full drift, for they meant to offend the Catholiques. and that doth well appeare pag. 121. of the Cancellaria: whear <hi>Achatius a Donau</hi> writes to <hi>Anhalt</hi> 15. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Nou. 1619.

that ther intention was, to expell pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſme; to preſeru them ſelfs from the yoke and ſeruitude of Spayne: and to preuent all forrein governement.

               <p>Yet y may ſay, <hi>uon bene diuiſa ſunt haec tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus.</hi> D. for it is euident, that Ridlies ſermon was after king Edwards death, and ſo could haue no shelter vnder his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; bycauſe all men of vnder-ſtanding know that the raign of a Prince commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not at the tyme of his coronation, but actuallie vpon the death of his predeceſſor.

               <p>As for Cranmor, he was a counſellor and oracle in the buſienes: and therfor was arraigned and condemned, with the Ladie Iane, and Guildeford Dudlie, as a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and principall aſſiſtant, of that treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practiſe, to diſherit bothe the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and to graft the princelie roſes vpon a crabtree ſtock. (as appeareth by the records in the kings bench.) and I may trevvlie affirm of that <hi>Proteus,</hi> that in all his actions, he showed hym ſelf ever ſeruilie plyable to anie humor of the kings.</p>
               <p>Firſt a principall inſtrument of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce, (whearby the court gates vvear ſet open, to welcome Ann Boodein.) then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, to ſerue the kings appetite, he and Cromwel wear the cheafactors, employed

               <p>So as Quene Elizabeths frends had no cawſe to fauour hym, either for dew reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of her, or of her father: or for kyndnes to her moother. and all vnpartiall men vvill condemn hym of inexcuſable iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that being a counſellor of ſtrate, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Metropolitan, and pretending to be a reformer of religion; he would betray his maiſter (whoſe creature he was) vvould fruſtrate and voyd his will, (wheareof he was cheaf executor:) would ſubſcribe to extinguish and root owt his iſſevv, his tvvo daughters, two Quenes, to ſet vp Ladie Iane in there places.</p>

               <p>And vpon theſe and ſuch like accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, God ſtirred one of theſe reformers, to vvrack an other.

               <p>And it aggreeth well with the Duke of Feria his letter to king Philip (yet extant to be ſeane;) vvhearin he certified the king, that Q.

               <p>I nead not relate, the like ſpeaches vſed by her to Monſieur Lanſack; ſeing manie honorable perſons haue affirmed the ſame: and ſeing her external profeſſion in publick, and her priuate chappell ded teſtifie, that either she was then ſincearlie in dead, or would be taken then to be a Catholick. And that was the cawſe, which mayd the world maruell more, at her great and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain chainge of religion.</p>
               <p>And the rather, bycauſe at her corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she vvas orderlie conſecrated, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:6201:158"/>
anointed at a Maſſe, by the Bushop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle: and she took the oath then, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Church, and vphold the liberties thereof, as her predeceſſors had doone.</p>
               <p>Which, vvithovvt aequiuocation, muſt neads be intended of that Church then being in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and whearin she was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and took that oathe: and not of the Idea of a new Church (a caſtle in the Ayre, to be hearafter erected and fownded, by lier authoritie and the Parliement.)</p>
               <p>But how euer she was before perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; she was now altered, and became too ſoodainlie Retrograde: and ſo, as in the opinion of manie prudent and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it a bated much the glorie of her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome and heroicall ſpirit: and gaue the world occaſion to ſuſpect that all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actions wear counterfeit and campo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for her ſecuritie to temporize: and to miſdowbt, that she was not innocent and cleare, of theſe great not capitall crymes layd to her charge (for vvhich, she had ſtood in no ſmal dainger.)</p>
               <p>Ant to ſpeak frelie and trewlie my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, she was a Prince of great Maieſtie and magnificens, but fitter for governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then deuotion: and of more pollicie then religion: and not as her ſiſter vvas, the ſame in a ſtorme and a calme; a

               <p>1. Firſt the long ſicknes of Q.

               <p>2.

(the which is related by Hows in prefat. of Q. Elizabeth.) for kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing well, that a king can not create a new religion as D. Bilſon ſayd trewlie, (meaning that it muſt be the act and work of a parlie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:) therfor to winn the Bushops, either to ſilenc or patienc, she wiſelie vſed that peace of art. The which thing vvas vvell noted by Monſieur de Mauuiſſier (vvho was long french Embaſſador in England, and a curious ſearcher and obſeruer of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that nature:) ſaith he (lib. 2. pag. 61.

in <hi>Les memoires de Monſieur Mich Caſtelnau.)</hi> Quene Elizabeth purpoſing to chainge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that she might the better vvinn the Bushops, she promiſed to follow ther adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in all things, and therby preuayled not a litle. And though manie fyne ſleights wear vſed, frownes and fauors, promiſes and threats: yet notwithſtanding by that parliement, both the ſtatuts for the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, and the abrogation of the old reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wear enacted.</p>
               <p>3. Add alſo, that when the act vvas mayd for ſupremacie, (vvhich muſt ever be, as the firſt great vvheale of motion:) bycauſe, by king Henries lavv, Bushops and Barons ſtood in dainger (for Syr Thomas Moor, and Bushop Fisher had giuen them vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to look to ther heads.) therfor novv, in this nevv edition of the ſupremacie, firſt the vvords of <hi>ſupreme head</hi> vvear chainged into <hi>ſupreme gouernor;</hi> (vvhich qualification of the vvords being aequiualent, vvas vſed but as a mask and shadovve, to bleare the eyes of the people.) and ſecondlie the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Lords vvear exempted from the rigour of the Oath, to vvinn them the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſent, to the act; and ſo to leaue the Bushops in the briars, to beare the brunt of the ſtorme enſewing.</p>
               <p>4. I knovv yow will admire, and yow
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:6201:160"/>
maye, how this chainge could be vvrought in the vpper howſe, by moſt voyces; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, ſo manie Bushops, and ſo manie Lords vvell affected to religion, had ther ſuffrages there. Remember firſt, that king Henrie pulling dovvne the Abbies, vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the ſtrenth of the Cleargie; taking avvay by that meanes, twentie fiue voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Abbots, who ſatt there as Barons of Parliement. and beſides, <hi>Sinon</hi> (who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that buſienes) showed all his conning therin, and as a maiſter of his art. For the noble Earl of Aro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>del, (abuſed and fed with a vayne hope) by the ayd of the Duke Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thfolk engroſſed into his hands the <hi>proxies,</hi> and voyces of ſo manie Lords, to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at his pleaſure, and to ſerue and further the Quenes deſyre and ends, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks wear overſwayed and born downe, by the pluralitie of ſix voyces onelie. And how God rewarded theſe tvvo great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (the inſtruments of that ſeruice:) the world may iudg, by ther afflictions as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that haunted them. (tho to expiat that fault, the religious and noble, Earl Philip, ſuffred the martyrdome of a languishing ſowl.) A ſtrainge, and memorable mattet it was, to haue a new religion introduced, and no Bushop nor religion man, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and aduance it with one voyce. for
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:6201:160"/>
the vehement oration of Abbot Fecknam aginſt it, is fresh yet in memorie: and how all the Bushops, <hi>obstinate refragati ſunt,</hi> Camden doth witnes. and that noble Lord Montagew (ſenſible of the ſcandall the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof) oppoſed it vvithall his force, (vvho together vvith D.

               </p>
               <p>But for ther better aſſurance, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle in the vpperhowſe, and more ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glie to ouer-rule the Bushops, and the Abbots: the Quene created diuers nevv lords, <hi>VVilliam</hi> lord <hi>Parr,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> (a good ſpeaker, and a wiſe man<hi>:)</hi> the Earle of Hartford, the Vicount Bindon, the lord <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bletſo,</hi> and the lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> (all Proteſtants and men fitt to build a new Churche.)</p>
               <p>And to be better armed: the Catholick partie was weakened, by diſcharging from the counſell table, manie of the old coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, the lord Chancelor, the lord Priuie ſeale, Secretarie <hi>Boxall,</hi> and <hi>Syr Frances Englefeald.</hi> and in ther roomes, wear pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Syr Nicholas Bacon, the Marques of

               <p>Furthermore, to taik all ſcrupule owt of the heads, and harts of the people, and that they might conceaue, that the ſeruice and religion ſtill continued, the ſame the ould was (but tranſtated into Englishe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for ther better edification, and vnder ſtanding:) they directed, that the alteration should be framed as near to the old, as they might well doe.</p>
               <p>And ſo it was in dead, verrie politiclie handled. For they bothe admitted and continued the title and iuriſdiction of Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, (vvith ſome litl grace, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:) and they permitted the vſe of ſurpliſes, caeremonies, anthems, Organs, and manie prayers in the forme of the old. Whearby the Quene, vvas the better able to excuſe her fact, to forrein princes, for this great chainge, as she ded vſe the ſame for her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>Syr Nicholas Bacon, was an others; his brother in lawe, a man of Deap iudgment, of more knowledg in the lawes, and a more plauſible Orator.</p>
               <p>I may not forget the Lord Robert (who ſolelie to poſſes the Quenes fauor, by a trick diſcarded Syr Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pickering, then a fauorite and a courtlie gentlman.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I omitt Seigneur Nicholas Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmorton, S.

               <p>Better Enginers, and fitter men, could, neither haue bean wished nor fuwnd, then all theſe wear to vndermine and caſt dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the Cleargie, and the old Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement. vvho poſſeſſing vvholie the eare and grace of the Quene, ſatt vvith command at the ſtearne, and as pylots of great eſtimation, guided the courſe both of the Church and commonwelth at ther pleaſure, (thoughe manie men vvondered how maiſter ſecretarie could ſo ſoone, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

Notwithſtanding all this choyce of men, and preparation of meanes: ther courſes and cownſells, gaue occaſion of more trowbles, continual feares, and greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and daingers to the Quene the realme, in all her tyme: then ever anie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects of innouation committed.</p>
               <p>And no maruel, for <hi>ludit in humanis diuina potentia,</hi> God doth skorn and fruſtrate the pollicies and shifts of men, that haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els to truſt to but shifts: and he vvill euer teach the wiſeſt, to ſee ther follies; and (a litl to humble them,) thoſe that ar moſt prouident shall by ther errors learn, that <hi>plus est in arte, quam in artifice.</hi>

               <p>For now the Quene, (by this act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation, left deſtitute of all her allies and confaederates) vvas driuen to ſtand vpon her own gard, and lie open to all ſtormes: hauing France an enemie, and Spayne (a frend skarſe contented.) and ſo was driuen euen at firſt, to ronne vpon a rock, (forced to aſſiſt the rebells in Scotland againſt ther Soouerain) and to ſend them ayd to expell the french, employed ther for ther Quenes ſeruice.</p>
               <p>It may de, yow think this a trifle: mark

the reſt. To ſuccor the Admirall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells in France: she Inuaded Normandie, and took poſſeſſion of Nevvhauen and Deape, deliuered to her by the Vidame of Chartres. was this a glorie? the diſgrace in looſing and ill defending Newhauen, was a greater bleamish to them: then it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to haue them yealded and offred to the Quenes diſpoſing. and ſpeciallie, ſeing they might therby either haue brought <hi>Callice</hi> home againe; or haue locked vp the gates of Roan and Paris.</p>
               <p>And they ded neither; but bring home the great plague, (as a ſcourge to the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for that offence.) furthermore, for the ſecuritie of the realme, and to diuert all warres from home, they wear driuen, (not withowt touch of the Quenes honor) to kindl the fyre, in all other adiacent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then to publish a declaration and reaſon of ther actions (as yf the world could not read the trew cavvſes of actions, vvithovvt the ſpectacles of thoſe ancient Senators.) Whearupon they ded ayd the Princes of Orenge againſt king Philip, (vnder pretenc of amitie and league vvith the howſe of Burgondie, and the kings of England.) which was a litl to groſſe for ſo excellent vvitts; conſidering that the amitie vvas contracted with no ſubiects

               <p>And, the showe of Religion, ſerued them fitlie for there purpoſe. But ſurelie, I haue hard verrie wiſe men much condemn the courſe.</p>

               <p>And whear as perhaps for politick cavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the king and the Lords may diſlike anie publick diſputation, vpon the grownds of religion: yet this may well be granted, (and the french kings preſident, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it.)</p>
               <p>The preaſts and fathers, offer to prooue that Iewel (the mainſter Carpenter of that Apologie of the Churche of England:) that Luther, Caluin, Melancthon, and the later Doctors (Colonells of the new plantation,) haue overcrowed and born down the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks (for opinion of truthe, ſinceritie, and learning) onely by <hi>falſe quotations, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, falſifications, miſrecitalls:</hi> and that

And this they humblie pray and hope, that his Maieſtie in his own tyme vvould be pleaſed to grant; by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe be heynous offences; and the temple of veritie can not be builded vpon error and falſe grownds: and bycauſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and forgeries, be <hi>stratagemata ſatanae:</hi> that at leaſt he would permitt the triall of that iuſt accuſation; and ſo afthervvard eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>team of ther integritie, as they shall acquite them ſelfs.</p>

               <p>I muſt freelie anſwer, that iealouſie is trewlie deſcribed to be full of eyes, and yet all pur-blind: fearefull of her own shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we, euer <hi>in motu trepidationis,</hi> and contrarie to the motions, of other ſtarres.</p>
               <p>And tho they vvear great ſtateſmen, ye
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6201:174"/>
with all ther Opticks they could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the great daingers like to fall vpon them, till they wear at ther doors. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by error drawen and prouoked them; yet took they the courſe, rather to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the flame, then quench the fyre: to encreas the mallice then preuent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheaf.</p>
               <p>For firſt yf anie ſuch confaederation had bean, (which never yet could be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor was recorded in anie hiſtorie was it probable, that ſo great and ſo wiſe Princes, would acquaint the poor ſpeculatiue preaſts at Reams or Douay, or the fathers of the ſocietie, with ther plats and intentions? is it credible that they would manage mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate ſo vveakelie? yea, but theſe Princes purpoſed by the meanes of the preaſts and religious, to prepare a partie aſſiſtant in England; how? by reconciling the people to the Pope, that they might ioyne, vvith hym and the king of Spaynes armie. One error begets an other: for preaſt doe not reconcile men to the Pope, but to God and his Churche.</p>
               <p>1. And yet ſurelie it was a miracle, that emong ſo manie preaſts, and in ſo long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and when Spies and intelligencers wear employed and rewarded; neither anie ſuch preaſt could be nominated, (who was then
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:6201:175"/>
or after, ſo corrupted or induced by theſe great Princes:) nor anie was afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or diſcouered, for anie ſuch treſpaſſe. and which is moſt to be marked, not anie ſubiect was called in quaeſtion, or accuſed for entertaining anie preaſts to that end. then how phantaſtical was this feare? what an imagination of Chimeraes and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? moſt iniurious, to touch the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the English preaſts in generall, and by ſtatuts and proclamations, to call ther names and ther liues in quaeſtion: and to haue no ſu ſufficient vvitneſſes to accuſe them. no euidenc againſt them, nothing but preſumptions and probabilities to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint them of treaſon. the lyfe and honor of ſubiects, wear wont to be eſteamed more pretious: and the function of preaſts, more reuerenced.</p>
               <p>2. I may alſo add this: that when the king of Spaynes armado, was vnder ſayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards England, not a preaſt nor Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man was fownd in it. And though in the proclamation, they wear traduced to be men ſuborned for preparation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the way leuel for ther better landing: yet hovv vvell they prepared it, appeareth by this, that neither preaſt nor Catholick, vvear apprehended and attainted for anie ſuch offenc, as is afore ſayd.</p>
               <p>

3. Beſides hovv litl affianc the king of Spayn had in the English preaſts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of that tyme, was demonſtrated by this; that all the religious English at Valladolid and Burgos 1589. wear fettered and committed cloſe priſoners, when the armie of England aſſaulted Lisbone, and invaded Portingal.</p>
               <p>Furthermore in all the actuall treaſons and conſpiracies, ſuppoſed to be mayd againſt Q. Elizabeth: ther was never preaſt, or monk, or friar touched or taynted for anie of them. For certanlie the holie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of God will not ſuffer nor indure ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie machinations: and cloyſters, bread better humors, eleuate ther ſowles from the world. they think not of Princes but in ther prayers; and <hi>venite ad iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Bycauſe it is a matter (which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all preaſts:) it is neceſſarie to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min it with deliberation. Cuthbert Mayn was indited at Launſton 1577. that he had, and obtained from Roome, a bull, and inſtrument for abſolution, and that maiſter Tregion, knowing hym to haue obtained the ſame 20.

               <p n="4">4. But that, which is moſt to be noted, is: that it was printed at Douay; and by the enditement, he was accuſed that 1. Octob. 1597. he ded obtain from Room the afore ſayd inſtrument. for the law intended, that the treſpaſſor should obtain immediatlie from, the Pope, not a copie, but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf. and that it should contain ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me matter preiudiciall to the Quenes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or the quiet and good of the ſtate, or to ſeduce and corrupt the ſubiects (for it is not to be imagined, that the parliement would maik that treaſon, by which no hurt nor dainger can enſew to the ſtate.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. But what bull was this? that maketh the matter cleare. it was a bull, concerning the Iubilie, which by the Pope is granted of courſe, and not at the ſuit of anie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon, and for all contries not for anie one, and once in 25. yeares. and that bull ded continue in force, butone yeare: which yeare was ended 1575.

(though the enditement contained altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>matter inſufficient,</hi> and impoſſible, and neither anſwearable, to the words, nor ſenc of the ſtatut.)</p>
               <p>For in this bull, ther wear neither words nor matter, to withdraw or ſeduce anie ſubiect from dew obedienc: neither vvas ther anie thing preiudicial to the Q. to be executed.

               <p>In that act, the Queſtion vvas, what was treaſon by the common law: now ſaith he. it is a principle in the expoſition of a ſtatut, that yf the preambl showeth anie dowbt to be before, either in common law, or ſome ſtatut, and afterward doth enact, that thus

it shall be: in that caſe it muſt be taken, <hi>that the lavve doubted of, vvas ſo before</hi> For ab expoſitors of dowbts, they would not ordaine it otherwiſe, then the law was.</p>
               <p>Now it appeareth, by that ſtatute, <hi>ſcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> by the common lawes of England, and by I.

For Oldcaſtel vvas condemned a Traytor for his act in one court: an heretick for his opinion, in an other court; and ſo wear Cranmor and Ridlie for ther actions. 2. yt muſt be the act of a ſubiect, againſt his ſoouerain. Now what hurt, had euer king H. 7. or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, by anie ſubiect, who was a preaſt, ſayd maſſ &amp;c. or can yovv show, that anie real treaſon by preaſts was committed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or intended againſt the late Quene? ded they euer procure ſedition, or ſtirr rebellion actuallie? 3. and that was neadful to be prooued; for Treaſon muſt be for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the higheſt degree: bycauſe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment extends it ſelf, to all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (that offends ſo,) to the ruine of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and to terrifie others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So then by the common lawes, it is not

treaſon. But D.

               <p>But was no man punished for religion in Q Eliz. tyme? 1. ther vvas a general pardon 1581. whearin, a ſtrict caution and prouiſo was. that the benefit thereof should not be extended to anie perſon in priſon, or recuſant, for matter of religion (and yet all malefactors, had ther part in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.) and was this no punishment, nor partialitie? 2. the Recuſants pay 20. li. povvnds a month, in regard of ther reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: is this no punishment? is not this properly called Sawl moonie? The Turk layeth not ſuch a tribut, vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienc of Chriſtians, nor Chriſtians vpon the Iewes. 3. the old prelates and Cleargie all dyed in priſon, or in exile, for ther reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and yet no man is punished, either in goods, or bodie, or libertie. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions ar theſe? and how palpable.</p>
               <p>The Ladie Morlie La. Brown, and La. Guildeford. 1575.

But to conclude, the loyaltie of theſe Recuſants might appeare to the king plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, by ther petition to his maieſtie 1604. and manie tymes after: and euer by ther obedienc. and in Q.

               <p>Touching the firſt poynt, the better and more charitable ſort of proteſtants, vvill not endure to hear ſo groſſ a paradox, which day lie is before ther eyes prooued falſe. for the Recuſants in E. liue emong yow, both peaceablie and neighborlie, and withowt ſcandall. yow buy and ſell with them: they performe all the offices of neighborhood, they denie no temporall dewties, neither tithes to miniſters (tho for ſacraments.) nor devvtie to magiſtrates, nor ſocietie euen with puritans. and it is a fals Surmiſe, that Catholicks hold Proteſtants, as haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques and excommunicate (a skarcrowe, to keap them a ſonder, and noorish diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as yf ther vvear a natural <hi>antipathia</hi> betwean them) But theſe Doctors, (who playe therin the <hi>Boutefeus,)</hi> remember not, that the Catholicks, deſeru more reſpect, and fauor, by the law of Senioritie (as the right heyrs of the Church, diſinherited of ther patrimonie.)

of Antichriſt, (who had captiuated, and ſeduced the vvhole world, in manie ages:) and therfor ſuch a prophet, was not to be teddered within the compaſſe and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of ordinarie profeſſors. Yf therupon, he neglected the ſway of authoritie, the titles of lawes, the glorie and maieſtie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the peace of common welths: yow can not obiect and lay it more to his charg, then <hi>Achab</hi> ded to Elias, <hi>Tune is es, qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbas Iſrael?</hi> The whole world was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a <hi>Litargie</hi> and <hi>Freneſie,</hi> (two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream diſeaſes,) which could not be cured with Manna, and gentl remedies<hi>:</hi> a violent diſeaſe requireth ſtrong purgations, and he is the trew <hi>Hippotrates,</hi> that can applie the proper cures to the world ſo infected. gods power is not abated, he can raiſe vp at his pleaſure extraordinarie men, to deliuer his people, from <hi>Aegipt</hi> and <hi>Babel,</hi> ſinn and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.

            <p>Stay ther and pawſe a litl. how can yow maik me know, and beleaue, that Luther was gods purſeuant, and not the harrold of Antichriſt? They vvill hear produce, the Colloquie of Altenburgh, wherin pag. 80.

            <p>So ded Nuncer poſſeſſ the Bowers of Germanie, as a man to whome God had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the Sword of Gedeon: ſo (abowt Luthers beginning, the age for new worlds, and nevv chainges) Thekel, perſuaded <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that God in the top of the <hi>Anti-Taurus,</hi> had appeared and reuealed to hym the reaſon he vſed to reforme ther religion.

And vvhy I maik this dowbt, I learned my leſſon of <hi>Beza, p.</hi> 86. <hi>l. vindicia cont.

            <p>Now touching his vacation; his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie calling could not authoriſe hym with ſo extraordinarie a powre, as to reforme the church, and preach new doctrine never hard of before.

vocation at Poiſſy; and his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vvas impugned ther by Cl. de Saincts and others, and in England by D. Sarauia &amp;c. They that ar ſo called, muſt prooue it by externall ſignes and miracles, as Moyſes and Elias ded: and yf he be an apoſtl, I may vrg hym with that of Tertullian <hi>de preſcript, c.</hi> 30. <hi>probent ſe eſſe Apoſtolos.</hi> He who called them to ſo high an office, could alſo geue them powre to approoue ther vocation, and induce the vvorld to accept, honor, and reuerenc them, by ther extraordinarie vvorks, and the teſtimonies of ther ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall vertues. But Luther had no ſuch calling, for that vvas euer inſeparablie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with miracles (as was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by Moyſes and Elias.) beſides it vvas not in vſe ſince the apoſtles tyme. yf I can prooue that, I shall hitt the byrd in the eye: and to prooue that, I pray yow let Luther Iudg hym ſelf. for he affirmeth the ſame propoſition <hi>tom.</hi> 5. <hi>VVitteb. in c.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Galat. p.</hi> 376. <hi>and in loc. com. claſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 20. and ſo doth <hi>Muſculus locis com. p.</hi> 304. ſo doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauia againſt Beza: ſo doth <hi>Piſcator vol.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:6201:220"/>
and vertue. Elias (3. <hi>Reg. c.</hi> 17.) at mount Oreb. would ſequeſter hym ſelf, in his caue from the noyce of the vvorld, from the ſight of vanitie, that he might eleuate his ſowle from mudd and earth, and maik yt more capable of deuine inſpirations, and pray with more feruor of ſpirite, and break that wild coult (the luſts of the flesh) with faſting and prayer. and ſo ded <hi>S. lo.

For in the Church of the <hi>Saepulchre,</hi> at Hieruſalem the Chriſtian Marronites Georgians, Aethiopians, Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Latins, haue ther alters and offer ther ſacrifices, to God (the which the Turks forther profit, as the Soldans and Saracens before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue fuffred and permitted.)

memorable battel of Lepanto. And for the encreaſe and prapagation of Chriſts glorie, he haith alſo erected ſeminaries for Grecians, Aſians, and Iewes: that the world may diſcouer who is the Antichriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third and laſt reaſon is. that they who ar ſo deſirous, to create the Pope An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: can not agree emong them ſelfs when he fell ſo fowl, as to deſerue the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Antichriſt. They can not name the perſon who was <hi>ſtella cadens de caelo:</hi> nor the age and tyme: nor the errors he ded fall into, wherby he was ſo iudged: nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce anie accuſers, <hi>testes fide digni,</hi> to iuſtifie the ſame. ask Caluin when the defection was, he anſwers <hi>multis abhinc ſeculis.</hi> S.

Melancthon, that in Soſimus tyme, the defection appeared 420. Beza aſsigneth Leo the Pope 440. Fulk nameth Boniface (and ſo doe willet, and downam anno 607.) Bullinger nameth Hildebrand (Gregor. 7.) anno 763. Whitaket, that Gregorie the Great, was the laſt pious, and trew Bushop. Parkins, abowt 900. yeares ſinc. <hi>Hoſpinian ab annis</hi> 1200. <hi>Lanaeus,</hi> abowt 574.</p>
            <p>So then, the vncertantie maiks ther iudgment erroneous: for all can not ſay
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:6201:228"/>
trew: and who ſaith treweſt they can not define. We ar not bownd ſaith D Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, to anſwer in what age ſuperſtition crept into the Church, by whome, nor at what tyme: and yet, in his anſwer to D. Sanders, p. 799. he ſwears, by hym that liueth, that the Pope is Antichriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But I wonder that they mean to maik the Pope Antichriſt: and the trew Church to be in Papatu, and yet Papatus not to be <hi>in Eccleſia.</hi> Aridl; my dull wit can not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. but ſeing I am ſure of this, that owt of that Church all haeretikes ded go: that <hi>exire,</hi> teacheth me that the ſanctuarie: owt of which they fled, was the Ark of Noah, the Church of God.</p>

            <p>But how can yow prooue, or aſſure me, and with what vvarrant of ſcripture, that no ſuch Antichriſt shal come. <hi>De fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis contingentibus,</hi> I think D.

But the Euangeliſt hauing ſet down his name, (the name of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man 666.) he that can maik <hi>Apocalypſis Apocalypſeos:</hi> vvhy doth he not, or can he not detect that Pope, and reueal to whome that name was dew?</p>
            <p>3. As by the firſt argument, yovv may <note place="margin">The voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the deuel.</note> diſcouer his vanitie; and hovv greatlie he differed from Elias: and by the ſecond, his calumniation prooueth hym an Impoſtor: ſo this, vvill vnmask, and vncaſe hym, he shall appear in his proper Coolors. His <hi>vocation</hi> they call extraordinarie: and ſo it is in dead. For it vvas by conferenc vvith the Deuel, (as he confeſſeth hym ſelf <hi>l. de Miſſa</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:6201:230"/>
But Luther hym ſelf, calls it <hi>diſceptatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and neither a drean nor a temptation. And yf it wear a ſpiritual temptation; that excuſeth not Luther, for he yealded to the Deuel, ſo ded never holie Iob, not anie ſanctified vaſſel.</p>
            <p>Balduinus a Lutheran, writes of purpoſe a book of that diſputation 1605 and he confeſſeth it vvas a real truthe, and not a dream (as D.

It rather prooueth that the conferenc vvas before Luthers fall; for othervviſe it had bean a dart caſt at rouers, and an idl temptation,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:6201:230"/>
yf Luthers had bean bean all readie ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded (as after his fall he was.) Beſides, yf it wear after that Luther abrogated the Maſſe, (as Bald. ſaith) then his <hi>ſola ſides,</hi> was a ſufficient buckler, to ward anie blow the deuel could geue hym, ther was no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of driuing hym to diſpayr, vvho had profeſſed that neither ſinns, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, nor I dolatrie paſt, could be cavvſes of his damnation, but onelie incredulitie. and as fals is it, that the deuel ſpoke alwaies <hi>de preterito,</hi> and not <hi>preſenti,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior eſt haec vinctio tua, quam baptiſatio ſaxi,</hi> and ſo perſvvades hym to contemne his vnction, which is ſpoken <hi>de preſenti,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touching <hi>deſperation.</hi> read the words, and weigh them, and all the <hi>deuels</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Maſſ: and yow will then fynd your own error.</p>

            <p>D. Whitacre, in his preface to W. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, excuſeth yt thus. pag. 8. greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc shall he not fynd, emong the trew pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the goſpel, and Churches refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then may be emong the children of God. Abowt the paſſeouer in the eaſt and weſt Churches, ther was bitter diſſenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet they ceaſed not to be Churches of Chriſt. Perfect concord is not to be hoped for, &amp;c. S. Peter and Paul, Auguſtin and Hierom diſagreed. And aftervvard. yet by Gods grace, all Churches reformed agree ſownd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in matters of faith, ſubſtancial, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation. So 1. he denieth that ther is anie ſuch diſcord 2. that all Churches reformed agree ſovvndlie in matters of faith. 3. by exampls he extenuates ther diuiſions.</p>
            <p>And Gualter profeſſeth in prefat. <hi>Ep. ad Rom.</hi> that there is good agreement for all articles emong them, <hi>ſola Sacramentaria ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatione excepta.</hi> I wonder of this confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and bold aſſeueration, in a matter ſo cleare. It is trew, the varianc betwean the two Apoſtles, and betwean theſe two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, was great: but as it ded

neither break ther vnion, nor hinder ther communion, nor mayd anie ſects: ſo alſo, it was managed with ſuch Chriſtian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, and temper, as ded not ſtain ther profeſſion. and when that is prooued, D. Wh. haith his anſwer. and to prooue yt, look vpon the <hi>diſorder</hi> and <hi>diſcord,</hi> betwean the Lutherans and Sacramentaries, hovv vvhote fyres haue bean kindled emong them, and hovv long? vvhat care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, at Swabach, at Marpurg, at Smalcald, and at Montpelgart, to haue reconciled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and they parted euer with ſo litl chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the world had no cawſe to hope for anie vnitie. And for ther harmonie how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wndlie they agree in matters of faith; as D. Whitacre affirmeth, yow shall beſt fynd by Schluſſelberg his works, whearby it is mayd manifeſt that they varie, in theſe poynts, <hi>de omnipotentia Chriſti,</hi> of <hi>predeſtination,</hi> of the force of Baptiſm, of the Euchariſt and reall preſenc, whether Chriſt dyed for all men, of original ſinn, in ther diſcipline, in ther liturgies, touching images, &amp;c. and ar all theſe trifles? The Palatinate Churches, in ther act. (as I haue showed before) would not permit the Lutherans, and for bad ther books: <hi>totus Lutheraniſmus è medio tollatur,</hi> generallie and preciſelie; and yet doe they agree ſowndlie?

of Tubing, a famous Lutheran, accuſeth the Caluiniſts of Arrianiſm: <hi>Henricus Petri</hi> prooueth at large <hi>Neſtorianiſmum Caluini.</hi> A great learned man in E. affirmed, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Lutherans ded obiect it in ſpirit of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: and whether they iudged right or no, is an other quaeſtion. an other anſvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they wear but ther priuate opinions, and not to be regarded.
